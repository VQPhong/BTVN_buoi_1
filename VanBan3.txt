<p> This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may  <em> look </em>  happy, but he's a  <em> little </em>  disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box. </p>
<p> Jack would really like... </p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1"> Roller blades </li>
	<li aria-level="1"> Magic tricks </li>
	<li aria-level="1"> Anything Pokemon </li>
	<li aria-level="1"> A motorized Lego set </li>
</ul>

<p> You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/"> toysrus.com </a>  and  <a href="http://www.etoys.com/"> eToys </a> . </p>
